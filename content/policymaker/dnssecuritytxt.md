## DNS Security.txt
   

The DNS Security TXT standard provides machine-readable records that define core attributes of your VDP, and is designed to be hosted using [DNS TXT records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record) in your domain/s.

Just as security.txt can be deployed into either the root or the `.well-known` directory of a webserver, DNS Security TXT can be deployed to either the apex of a domain, or under a specially created `_security.<domain.com>` subdomain. This approach allows organizations to decide the approach that suits them best.
