## **Who is this for?**

*ContractMaker is a "one-stop-shop" policy generator for anyone building Request for Proposals (RFPs) to procure healthcare algorithm products. This tool can provide healthcare procurement officers with sample language -- including privacy, bias prevention, and transparency clauses -- to be embedded in new RFPs or to help update existing policies.*

Once completed, ContractMaker will provide you with:

- A set of program policies for soliciting privacy, bias prevention, and transparency requirements (for new or replacement RFPs).
- An intellectual property clause (for insertion into an existing RFP).
- A sample monitoring and evaluation pipeline for auditing of procured tools.

## **How does it work?**

*It's as easy as 1-2-3...*

1. ContractMaker will ask you a few questions about your organization's name, intended algorithm use case, preferred policy output format, and estimated risk thresholds.
2. The tool will use the [healthy-tech.org](https://healthy-tech.org/) standardized policy repository to create a policy just for you.
3. Download the policy in HTML or Markdown.

## **What's next?**

*This is the key part... We've worked hard to make creating these terms simple and standardized - the power comes when you put them to work!*

1. Plug and play the procurement clauses into your RFP after customizing them to suit your organization.
2. Share the Responsible AI Product Design sheet with bidding vendors so that they can tailor their proposals to fit your RFP criteria.
3. Use the RFP criteria included in the template procurement clauses to evaluate the vendor proposals with the transparency, privacy, and fairness principles in mind.

> Note: The policy output of ContractMaker does not constitute legal advice. Please consult your legal counsel for the specific suitability of the health-procurement.io terms in your organization.

## What will I require?

- The legal name of your organization.
- The email address through which you intend to receive the generated procurement clauses.
- The disclosure timeline that you intend to use in your policy for transparency requirements on the contract vendor side.
- The location where you intend to publish your RFP document. You can change this later if necessary.
