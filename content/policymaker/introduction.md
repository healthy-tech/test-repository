## **Who is this for?**

*ContractMaker is a "one-stop-shop" policy generator for anyone building Request for Proposals (RFPs) to procure healthcare algorithm products. Taking inspiration and guidance from the open source AI procurement clauses released by the City of Amsterdam, this tool provides healthcare procurement officers with sample language — including privacy, bias prevention, and transparency clauses — to be embedded in new RFPs or to help update existing policies.*

Once completed, ContractMaker will provide you with:

- A set of program policies for soliciting privacy, bias prevention, and transparency requirements (for new or replacement RFPs).
- An intellectual property clause (for insertion into an existing RFP).
- A sample monitoring and evaluation pipeline for auditing of procured tools.

## **How does it work?**

1. ContractMaker will ask you a few questions about your organization's name, intended algorithm use case, and preferred notification disclosure window.
2. The tool will generate procurement document clauses and will allow you to download the policy in HTML or Markdown.

## **What's next?**

*This is the key part. We've worked hard to simplify and standardize these terms; the power comes when you put them to work! Once you receive the draft language, you should:*

1. Plug and play the procurement clauses into your RFP after customizing them to suit your organization.
2. Use the RFP criteria included in the template procurement clauses to evaluate the vendor proposals with the transparency, privacy, and fairness principles in mind.
3. Use the guiding questions within the AI Model Design Checklist at each stage of the model lifecycle to promote transparency and accountability throughout the design process. Note: The outputs from ContractMaker does not constitute legal advice.

## What will I require?

- The legal name of your organization.
- The email address through which you intend to receive the generated procurement clauses.
- The disclosure timeline that you intend to use in your policy for transparency requirements on the contract vendor side.
- The location where you intend to publish your RFP document. You can change this later if necessary.
