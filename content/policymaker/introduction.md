## **Who is this for?**

*ContractMaker is a "one-stop-shop" policy generator for anyone building Request for Proposals (RFPs) for healthcare algorithm products with privacy, bias prevention, and transparency clauses. This can provide healthcare procurement officers with sample language to create new RFPs or update existing policies.*

Once completed, ContractMaker will provide you with:

- A set of program policies for soliciting privacy, bias prevention, and transparency requirements (for new or replacement RFPs).
- An intellectual property clause (for insertion into an existing RFP).
- A sample monitoring and evaluation pipeline for auditing of procured tools.

## **How does it work?**

*It's as easy as 1-2-3...*

1. ContractMaker will ask you a few questions about your organization's name, intended algorithm use case, preferred policy output format, and estimated risk thresholds.
2. The tool will use the [healthy-tech.org](https://healthy-tech.org/) standardized policy repository (created and maintained by industry experts, lawyers, and legal teams of large organizations that conduct RFPs) to create a policy just for you.
3. Download the policy in HTML or Markdown.

## **What's next?**

*This is the crucial part... We've worked hard to make creating these artifacts simple and standardized - the power comes when you put them to work!*

1. Plug and play the procurement clauses into your RFP after customizing it to suit your organization.
2. Each artifact comes with instructions, which you can pass on to the appropriate teams within your organization to implement and legal teams for review.
3. Your domain will be added to a list of domains scanned for updates into the [healthy-tech.org](https://healthy-tech.org/) Contact Database.

> Note: While we've engaged the legal opinion of many, the policy output of ContractMaker does not constitute legal advice. Please consult your legal counsel for the specific suitability of the health-procurement.io terms in your organization.

## What will I require?

- The legal name of your organization.
- The email address through which you intend to receive the generated procurement clauses.
- The location where you intend to publish your RFP document. You can change this later if necessary.
